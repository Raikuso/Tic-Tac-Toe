# Tic-Tac-Toe
---- Behind this project ----
This particular Project I started with copying code from another project I've seen on the internet and branched off from there.
The unfinished build is pretty much self explainatory. Though I've seen some people getting confused with my final build.

---- How to play ----
Player 1 starts. He/She can either press the keys displayed on the left side of the game or the keys on the right side of the game. Each key is represented in a grid which is representing the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
Be careful that you only press one key as you'd waste your opponents turn otherwise.
When a round is finished the winning player gets one score point. You can press "Y" to play another round, press "D" to delete the score and restart the game or press "N" to close the program.
